If you're reading this, it's the sign! Feel free to pick and implement some of the following :)

* check if a purple object (say account, buddy, conv, etc.) exists with purple find routines before calling *_new()
* complete useful methods implementations for PHP objects, let them be more
* standardize PHP internal object creation routines
* BuddyList should get rid of the static methods, require it to be an object again
* check stronger for memory leaks as when runing for longer it might exhaust memory (well, gc might help)
* testing
 - add tests with the null protocol
 - add some tests with test account for all protocols?
* do further code cleanups
* remove or comment out yet unused stuff
* support file uploads
* distributing
 - build rpm, deb and whatever on https://build.opensuse.org/ or where ever
 - make a custom PECL channel?
 - do windows builds
